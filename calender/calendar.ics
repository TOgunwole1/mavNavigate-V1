DESCRIPTION:2025 marks half a century as UTA welcomes students in the Fine 
 Arts Building. Classrooms\, studio spaces\, and communal areas have changed
  and moved quite a lot since spring 1975. This mini-exhibit\, open through 
 December 19\, features materials from the archives of the Department of Art
  & Art History and UTA Special Collections that focus on the period between
  1970-1975 when the new arts complex came into being.  \n\n \n\nWhen in the
  late 1960s\, UTA’s fine arts curricula was elevated from 2-year transfer p
 rograms to 4-year degree granting status\, this area became one of the fast
 est growing on campus. Noting that\, the 1970 letter from UTA President Fra
 nk Harrison\, addresses the need for “a building of approximately 225\,000 
 sq ft” to house the Departments of Architecture\, Art\, Music and Speech-Dr
 ama\, which by 1972 together counted 1\,326 majors  - nearly 10% of the tot
 al UTA student population (15\,432). \n\n \n\nFine Arts Complex began to ta
 ke shape along South Cooper Street around the existing University Theatre i
 n the summer 1973. In January 1975\, Shorthorn article showed perplexed stu
 dents next to a building map in a “castle-like” maze of a newly opened Fine
  Arts Center. The writers of Ft.Worth Star Telegram called it “the mammoth 
 4-story building\,” the “great Wall of China” cutting through UTA campus an
 d pointed at its “massive and impersonal” style\, with a giant loggia as it
 s most distinguishing feature.  \n\n \n\nOn display at the Visual Resource 
 Collections Gallery are historic photographs\, press clippings\, old UTA ye
 arbooks\, the remnants of former art building\, which got demolished\, and 
 the materials from the original Fine Arts Building blueprints. Special than
 ks to Heather Claney (Reference Services Manager at UTA Special Collections
 )\, Mark Cook (UTA Digitization Services Manager)\, Nicholas William (Lead 
 Digitization Specialist)\, Jack Plummer (Professor Emeritus\, Department of
  Art and Art History)\, and Rita Lasater (former Director of the Visual Res
 ource Commons) for documenting\, preserving the traces of time\, and helpin
 g us navigate through the archives to carry the memory further.  \n\n \n\nT
 he Visual Resource Collectiosn Gallery is open Monday-Friday\, 9 a.m.-5 p.m
 .

DESCRIPTION:2025 marks half a century as UTA welcomes students in the Fine 
 Arts Building. Classrooms\, studio spaces\, and communal areas have changed
  and moved quite a lot since spring 1975. This mini-exhibit\, open through 
 December 19\, features materials from the archives of the Department of Art
  & Art History and UTA Special Collections that focus on the period between
  1970-1975 when the new arts complex came into being.  \n\n \n\nWhen in the
  late 1960s\, UTA’s fine arts curricula was elevated from 2-year transfer p
 rograms to 4-year degree granting status\, this area became one of the fast
 est growing on campus. Noting that\, the 1970 letter from UTA President Fra
 nk Harrison\, addresses the need for “a building of approximately 225\,000 
 sq ft” to house the Departments of Architecture\, Art\, Music and Speech-Dr
 ama\, which by 1972 together counted 1\,326 majors  - nearly 10% of the tot
 al UTA student population (15\,432). \n\n \n\nFine Arts Complex began to ta
 ke shape along South Cooper Street around the existing University Theatre i
 n the summer 1973. In January 1975\, Shorthorn article showed perplexed stu
 dents next to a building map in a “castle-like” maze of a newly opened Fine
  Arts Center. The writers of Ft.Worth Star Telegram called it “the mammoth 
 4-story building\,” the “great Wall of China” cutting through UTA campus an
 d pointed at its “massive and impersonal” style\, with a giant loggia as it
 s most distinguishing feature.  \n\n \n\nOn display at the Visual Resource 
 Collections Gallery are historic photographs\, press clippings\, old UTA ye
 arbooks\, the remnants of former art building\, which got demolished\, and 
 the materials from the original Fine Arts Building blueprints. Special than
 ks to Heather Claney (Reference Services Manager at UTA Special Collections
 )\, Mark Cook (UTA Digitization Services Manager)\, Nicholas William (Lead 
 Digitization Specialist)\, Jack Plummer (Professor Emeritus\, Department of
  Art and Art History)\, and Rita Lasater (former Director of the Visual Res
 ource Commons) for documenting\, preserving the traces of time\, and helpin
 g us navigate through the archives to carry the memory further.  \n\n \n\nT
 he Visual Resource Collectiosn Gallery is open Monday-Friday\, 9 a.m.-5 p.m
 .

DESCRIPTION:2025 marks half a century as UTA welcomes students in the Fine 
 Arts Building. Classrooms\, studio spaces\, and communal areas have changed
  and moved quite a lot since spring 1975. This mini-exhibit\, open through 
 December 19\, features materials from the archives of the Department of Art
  & Art History and UTA Special Collections that focus on the period between
  1970-1975 when the new arts complex came into being.  \n\n \n\nWhen in the
  late 1960s\, UTA’s fine arts curricula was elevated from 2-year transfer p
 rograms to 4-year degree granting status\, this area became one of the fast
 est growing on campus. Noting that\, the 1970 letter from UTA President Fra
 nk Harrison\, addresses the need for “a building of approximately 225\,000 
 sq ft” to house the Departments of Architecture\, Art\, Music and Speech-Dr
 ama\, which by 1972 together counted 1\,326 majors  - nearly 10% of the tot
 al UTA student population (15\,432). \n\n \n\nFine Arts Complex began to ta
 ke shape along South Cooper Street around the existing University Theatre i
 n the summer 1973. In January 1975\, Shorthorn article showed perplexed stu
 dents next to a building map in a “castle-like” maze of a newly opened Fine
  Arts Center. The writers of Ft.Worth Star Telegram called it “the mammoth 
 4-story building\,” the “great Wall of China” cutting through UTA campus an
 d pointed at its “massive and impersonal” style\, with a giant loggia as it
 s most distinguishing feature.  \n\n \n\nOn display at the Visual Resource 
 Collections Gallery are historic photographs\, press clippings\, old UTA ye
 arbooks\, the remnants of former art building\, which got demolished\, and 
 the materials from the original Fine Arts Building blueprints. Special than
 ks to Heather Claney (Reference Services Manager at UTA Special Collections
 )\, Mark Cook (UTA Digitization Services Manager)\, Nicholas William (Lead 
 Digitization Specialist)\, Jack Plummer (Professor Emeritus\, Department of
  Art and Art History)\, and Rita Lasater (former Director of the Visual Res
 ource Commons) for documenting\, preserving the traces of time\, and helpin
 g us navigate through the archives to carry the memory further.  \n\n \n\nT
 he Visual Resource Collectiosn Gallery is open Monday-Friday\, 9 a.m.-5 p.m
 .

DESCRIPTION:2025 marks half a century as UTA welcomes students in the Fine 
 Arts Building. Classrooms\, studio spaces\, and communal areas have changed
  and moved quite a lot since spring 1975. This mini-exhibit\, open through 
 December 19\, features materials from the archives of the Department of Art
  & Art History and UTA Special Collections that focus on the period between
  1970-1975 when the new arts complex came into being.  \n\n \n\nWhen in the
  late 1960s\, UTA’s fine arts curricula was elevated from 2-year transfer p
 rograms to 4-year degree granting status\, this area became one of the fast
 est growing on campus. Noting that\, the 1970 letter from UTA President Fra
 nk Harrison\, addresses the need for “a building of approximately 225\,000 
 sq ft” to house the Departments of Architecture\, Art\, Music and Speech-Dr
 ama\, which by 1972 together counted 1\,326 majors  - nearly 10% of the tot
 al UTA student population (15\,432). \n\n \n\nFine Arts Complex began to ta
 ke shape along South Cooper Street around the existing University Theatre i
 n the summer 1973. In January 1975\, Shorthorn article showed perplexed stu
 dents next to a building map in a “castle-like” maze of a newly opened Fine
  Arts Center. The writers of Ft.Worth Star Telegram called it “the mammoth 
 4-story building\,” the “great Wall of China” cutting through UTA campus an
 d pointed at its “massive and impersonal” style\, with a giant loggia as it
 s most distinguishing feature.  \n\n \n\nOn display at the Visual Resource 
 Collections Gallery are historic photographs\, press clippings\, old UTA ye
 arbooks\, the remnants of former art building\, which got demolished\, and 
 the materials from the original Fine Arts Building blueprints. Special than
 ks to Heather Claney (Reference Services Manager at UTA Special Collections
 )\, Mark Cook (UTA Digitization Services Manager)\, Nicholas William (Lead 
 Digitization Specialist)\, Jack Plummer (Professor Emeritus\, Department of
  Art and Art History)\, and Rita Lasater (former Director of the Visual Res
 ource Commons) for documenting\, preserving the traces of time\, and helpin
 g us navigate through the archives to carry the memory further.  \n\n \n\nT
 he Visual Resource Collectiosn Gallery is open Monday-Friday\, 9 a.m.-5 p.m
 .

DESCRIPTION:2025 marks half a century as UTA welcomes students in the Fine 
 Arts Building. Classrooms\, studio spaces\, and communal areas have changed
  and moved quite a lot since spring 1975. This mini-exhibit\, open through 
 December 19\, features materials from the archives of the Department of Art
  & Art History and UTA Special Collections that focus on the period between
  1970-1975 when the new arts complex came into being.  \n\n \n\nWhen in the
  late 1960s\, UTA’s fine arts curricula was elevated from 2-year transfer p
 rograms to 4-year degree granting status\, this area became one of the fast
 est growing on campus. Noting that\, the 1970 letter from UTA President Fra
 nk Harrison\, addresses the need for “a building of approximately 225\,000 
 sq ft” to house the Departments of Architecture\, Art\, Music and Speech-Dr
 ama\, which by 1972 together counted 1\,326 majors  - nearly 10% of the tot
 al UTA student population (15\,432). \n\n \n\nFine Arts Complex began to ta
 ke shape along South Cooper Street around the existing University Theatre i
 n the summer 1973. In January 1975\, Shorthorn article showed perplexed stu
 dents next to a building map in a “castle-like” maze of a newly opened Fine
  Arts Center. The writers of Ft.Worth Star Telegram called it “the mammoth 
 4-story building\,” the “great Wall of China” cutting through UTA campus an
 d pointed at its “massive and impersonal” style\, with a giant loggia as it
 s most distinguishing feature.  \n\n \n\nOn display at the Visual Resource 
 Collections Gallery are historic photographs\, press clippings\, old UTA ye
 arbooks\, the remnants of former art building\, which got demolished\, and 
 the materials from the original Fine Arts Building blueprints. Special than
 ks to Heather Claney (Reference Services Manager at UTA Special Collections
 )\, Mark Cook (UTA Digitization Services Manager)\, Nicholas William (Lead 
 Digitization Specialist)\, Jack Plummer (Professor Emeritus\, Department of
  Art and Art History)\, and Rita Lasater (former Director of the Visual Res
 ource Commons) for documenting\, preserving the traces of time\, and helpin
 g us navigate through the archives to carry the memory further.  \n\n \n\nT
 he Visual Resource Collectiosn Gallery is open Monday-Friday\, 9 a.m.-5 p.m
 .

 Telegram.\n\n \n\nThe exhibit will include four painted portraits Schieffer
  created in 2025 based on the photographs he took of Texan soldiers serving
  in the war and selections from his collection of letters and photographs t
